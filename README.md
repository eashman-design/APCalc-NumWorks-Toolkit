# APCalc-NumWorks-Toolkit

A curated collection of Python scripts for NumWorks calculators, designed to support learning in AP Calculus AB.

## Purpose

This toolkit provides educational scripts that help students understand calculus concepts through structured, step-by-step computation. Every script is designed to reinforce conceptual understanding, not to replace it.

## Target Audience

- AP Calculus AB students
- Educators teaching AP Calculus AB
- Self-learners seeking to deepen their understanding of calculus fundamentals

## Ethical Statement

This toolkit is built for **learning**, not for circumventing the educational process. Each script is designed to:

- Show reasoning and intermediate steps
- Reinforce understanding of underlying concepts
- Support honest practice and study

**This is not a shortcut tool. It is a learning companion.**

Students are responsible for using these tools ethically and in accordance with their school's academic integrity policies and College Board examination rules.

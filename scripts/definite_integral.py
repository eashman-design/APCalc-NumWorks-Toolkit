"""
Definite Integral Evaluator for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script helps students understand definite integrals as accumulated change
and signed area under a curve. It provides numerical integration with clear
explanations of the process and meaning of the result.

The script reinforces the connection between Riemann sums and the definite
integral, showing how discrete approximations converge to the integral value.
Output includes interpretation of the integral in terms of net area and
accumulated quantity.

Target Topics:
- Definite integral as limit of Riemann sums
- Numerical integration techniques
- Interpretation of integral values as net signed area
- Connection between integration and accumulation

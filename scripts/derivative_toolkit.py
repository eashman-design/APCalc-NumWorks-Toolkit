Derivative Toolkit for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script supports students in understanding derivatives through numerical
computation and conceptual reinforcement. It demonstrates the relationship
between a function and its rate of change, helping students visualize and
interpret derivative values in context.

The script emphasizes the limit definition of the derivative and connects
numerical approximations to the underlying calculus concepts. Output includes
explanations of what the derivative represents at each point evaluated.

Target Topics:
- Definition of the derivative as a limit
- Numerical derivative approximation
- Interpretation of derivative values
- Connection between derivative sign and function behavior

"""
Motion and Rate-of-Change Helper for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script supports students working with motion problems by clarifying
the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration. It helps
students interpret derivatives and integrals in the context of physical
motion along a line.

The script reinforces understanding of how velocity is the derivative of
position, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and displacement
is the integral of velocity. Output includes conceptual explanations of
what each quantity represents and how they relate.

Target Topics:
- Position, velocity, and acceleration relationships
- Interpreting derivatives as rates of change in motion
- Computing displacement and total distance
- Analyzing motion from graphs and functions

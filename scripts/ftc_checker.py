"""
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Explorer for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script helps students understand and apply both parts of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. It demonstrates the connection between
differentiation and integration, showing how these operations are inverses.

The script reinforces understanding of accumulation functions and how
their derivatives relate to the original integrand. Output explains the
theorem's meaning and shows how it applies to specific examples.

Target Topics:
- FTC Part 1: Derivative of an accumulation function
- FTC Part 2: Evaluating definite integrals using antiderivatives
- Connection between differentiation and integration
- Accumulation functions and their properties

Free-Response Question Utilities for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script provides utilities that support students practicing AP Calculus
free-response questions. It helps with common FRQ tasks such as computing
average values, analyzing tabular data, and interpreting results in context.

The script emphasizes the reasoning and communication skills required for
FRQs, not just computation. Output is structured to model clear mathematical
communication as expected on the AP exam.

Target Topics:
- Average value of a function
- Working with tabular and graphical data
- Interpreting calculus results in applied contexts
- Structuring clear mathematical explanations

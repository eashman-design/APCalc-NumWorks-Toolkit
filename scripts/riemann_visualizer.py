"""
Riemann Sum Visualizer for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script provides visual and numerical exploration of Riemann sums,
helping students understand how rectangles approximate area under a curve.
It demonstrates left, right, and midpoint approximations, showing how
increasing the number of subdivisions improves accuracy.

The script emphasizes the conceptual foundation of integration by making
the summation process visible and interactive. Output explains the
geometric meaning of each approximation method and how they relate to
the true integral.

Target Topics:
- Left, right, and midpoint Riemann sums
- Effect of subdivision count on approximation accuracy
- Visual representation of rectangular approximation
- Connection between Riemann sums and definite integrals

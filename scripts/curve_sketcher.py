"""
Curve Sketching Assistant for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script helps students analyze functions for curve sketching by
identifying key features: critical points, inflection points, intervals
of increase/decrease, and concavity. It reinforces how first and second
derivatives reveal the shape of a function's graph.

The script emphasizes the connection between algebraic analysis and
graphical behavior, helping students develop intuition for how derivative
information translates to curve shape. Output explains the significance
of each feature identified.

Target Topics:
- Critical points and local extrema
- Intervals of increase and decrease
- Inflection points and concavity
- Using derivative information to sketch curves

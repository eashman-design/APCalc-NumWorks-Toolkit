Optimization Problem Solver for AP Calculus AB

Educational Goal:
This script guides students through optimization problems by emphasizing
the reasoning process: identifying constraints, forming objective functions,
finding critical points, and verifying extrema. It supports numerical
exploration while reinforcing the calculus concepts underlying optimization.

The script helps students understand why derivatives are used to find
maximum and minimum values and how the first and second derivative tests
work. Output walks through the optimization process step by step.

Target Topics:
- Setting up optimization problems
- Finding critical points using derivatives
- First and second derivative tests for extrema
- Interpreting solutions in context

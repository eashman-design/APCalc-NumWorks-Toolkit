# Installation

This guide describes how to upload scripts from this toolkit to your NumWorks calculator.

## Requirements

- A NumWorks calculator (N0110 or N0120 recommended)
- A computer with a USB port
- A compatible web browser (Chrome or Chromium-based browsers work best)

## Steps

1. **Connect your calculator** to your computer using the USB cable.

2. **Open the NumWorks workshop** at [https://my.numworks.com/python/](https://my.numworks.com/python/) in your web browser.

3. **Click "Connect"** and select your NumWorks calculator from the browser's device list.

4. **Add a new script** by clicking the "Add script" button.

5. **Copy the contents** of the desired `.py` file from this repository and paste it into the script editor.

6. **Name the script** appropriately (e.g., `derivative` for `derivative_toolkit.py`).

7. **Click "Upload"** to transfer the script to your calculator.

8. **Repeat** for any additional scripts you wish to install.

## Verification

After uploading, navigate to the Python app on your calculator. Your uploaded scripts should appear in the script list. Select a script and run it to verify successful installation.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you are using a compatible browser.
- Try a different USB cable or port if connection fails.
- Restart your calculator and try again.
- Check that your calculator firmware is up to date.

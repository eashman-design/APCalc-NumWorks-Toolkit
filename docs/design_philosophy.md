# Design Philosophy

This document outlines the pedagogical principles guiding the development of this toolkit.

## Core Principles

### 1. Reasoning Over Results

Every script in this toolkit prioritizes showing **how** and **why** over simply providing answers. A numerical result without understanding is educationally worthless.

Scripts should:
- Display intermediate steps
- Explain what computations represent
- Connect numerical results to calculus concepts

### 2. Conceptual Clarity

Scripts must reinforce the concepts taught in AP Calculus AB. The goal is to deepen understanding of:
- Limits and their role in calculus
- Derivatives as rates of change
- Integrals as accumulation
- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### 3. Interpretation Emphasis

Calculus is not just computation—it is interpretation. Scripts should:
- Prompt students to consider what results mean
- Connect abstract mathematics to concrete applications
- Model the kind of reasoning expected on AP free-response questions

### 4. Steps Before Shortcuts

Efficiency in this toolkit means **clarity and reliability**, not clever tricks that obscure understanding. A script that shows five clear steps is better than one that produces an answer in one opaque operation.

### 5. Active Learning Support

Scripts should support active learning by:
- Encouraging experimentation
- Making it easy to try different inputs
- Helping students build intuition through exploration

## What This Toolkit Is Not

- **Not a CAS**: This toolkit does not perform symbolic computation.
- **Not a shortcut**: Scripts are designed to support learning, not bypass it.
- **Not comprehensive**: This toolkit covers key topics, not every possible calculus problem.

## Alignment with AP Curriculum

All content aligns with the AP Calculus AB curriculum as defined by the College Board. Scripts do not introduce techniques or topics beyond the AB scope.

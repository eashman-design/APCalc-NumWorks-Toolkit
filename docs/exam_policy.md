# Exam Policy and Ethical Use

This document outlines the ethical guidelines and exam-related considerations for using this toolkit.

## Purpose Statement

This toolkit is designed for **learning and practice**, not for use during examinations unless explicitly permitted.

## Student Responsibility

Students are solely responsible for:

- Understanding and following their school's academic integrity policies
- Knowing what tools and resources are permitted during exams
- Using this toolkit in ways that support genuine learning

## AP Exam Considerations

The AP Calculus AB exam has specific rules about calculator use:

- **Exam Mode**: NumWorks calculators have an exam mode that restricts functionality. When exam mode is active, Python scripts may not be accessible.

- **Permitted Functionality**: The College Board specifies what calculator capabilities are allowed. Students must verify that their calculator usage complies with current AP exam policies.

- **Script Availability**: Even if scripts are installed, they may be inaccessible during official testing due to exam mode restrictions.

## Ethical Guidelines

1. **Use for learning**: These scripts are designed to help you understand calculus, not to replace understanding.

2. **Practice honestly**: When practicing for exams, simulate exam conditions accurately.

3. **Do not misrepresent**: Never claim work produced with computational assistance as unaided work unless permitted.

4. **Respect academic integrity**: Follow all applicable academic honesty policies.

## Disclaimer

The authors of this toolkit are not responsible for any academic integrity violations resulting from misuse of these tools. Use responsibly and ethically.

# Contributing to APCalc-NumWorks-Toolkit

Contributions are welcome but curated to maintain educational quality and alignment with the project's goals.

## Guiding Principles

All contributions must adhere to the following:

1. **Educational Alignment**: Every addition must serve a clear educational purpose within the AP Calculus AB curriculum.

2. **Reasoning-First Design**: Scripts must prioritize showing reasoning and steps over raw computation. The goal is understanding, not just answers.

3. **Conceptual Integrity**: Contributions should reinforce calculus concepts as taught in the AP curriculum. Do not introduce advanced techniques that bypass foundational understanding.

4. **NumWorks Compatibility**: All code must run within the constraints of the NumWorks Python environment.

5. **Ethical Use**: No contribution should facilitate academic dishonesty. Scripts must be designed as learning tools.

## Submission Guidelines

Before submitting, ensure your contribution:

- Aligns with AP Calculus AB scope (v1)
- Includes clear documentation explaining the educational intent
- Follows the existing code style and structure
- Has been tested on NumWorks hardware or the official emulator

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed for educational value, code quality, and alignment with project philosophy. Acceptance is at the maintainers' discretion.
